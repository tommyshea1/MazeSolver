# 🧠 MazeSolver

A Python-based maze generation and solving program built using object-oriented programming principles. This project visually demonstrates pathfinding logic using a grid-based system.

---

## 📌 Features

- Maze generation using randomized Prim’s algorithm
- Visual representation of maze and pathfinding via `graphics.py`
- Customizable grid size
- Modular structure with clearly defined classes and methods
- Unit tests included for core logic

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Tkinter (for graphics)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Random module for maze generation
- Custom test framework
